# System Improvements

This document outlines recent improvements made to the Blockchain Log Integrity System.

## 1. Increased Log Display Capacity

The frontend has been enhanced to show more logs at once, improving usability for large log datasets.

### Changes Made:

- Modified the `getRecentLogs` function in `api.js` to fetch 50 logs by default instead of 10
- Updated the default number of rows per page in both `LogBrowser.js` and `EnhancedLogBrowser.js` to 50
- Added more options in the pagination dropdown (10, 25, 50, 100)
- Updated the backend API in `recent-logs.js` to use 50 as the default limit and increased the maximum limit to 1000

### Benefits:

- Reduced need for pagination when reviewing logs
- Improved experience when analyzing large sets of related log entries
- Better visibility of system activity in a single view

## 2. Verification Process Visualization

Added a comprehensive visualization of the verification process to help users understand how blockchain verification works.

### Changes Made:

- Created a new `VerificationVisualizer` component that shows the step-by-step verification process
- Enhanced the API's verification response to include detailed verification steps
- Modified the log detail dialog to include this visualization
- Added explanatory text about how blockchain verification works
- Enhanced the error display to show specific discrepancies between expected and received log data

### Benefits:

- Users can see exactly which fields were tampered with, along with a clear comparison of values
- The verification process is no longer a "black box" - each step is visualized
- Educational value: helps users understand the blockchain verification concepts
- Improved trustworthiness by showing the specific changes detected in tampered logs

## 3. Utility Scripts for Batch Management

Several utility scripts were added to help manage and troubleshoot the batch creation process:

- **fix-logs.js**: Sends logs directly to the API, bypassing the log-shipper component
- **force-batch-process.js**: Attempts to trigger batch processing immediately
- **create-batch.js**: Creates test data and sends large batches of logs

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Batch Processing Delay**: The system processes logs into batches at 5-minute intervals by design
2. **Local Development vs. Deployed Service**: Configurations may differ between environments
3. **Log Flow**: logs → temporary storage → batch processing → blockchain storage → archiving
4. **Verification**: relies on archived logs with Merkle proofs and blockchain-stored roots

These improvements enhance both the usability and educational aspects of the system while providing better tools for testing and troubleshooting.
